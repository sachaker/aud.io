# Project Outline

**Project name:** aud.io

**Project goal:** To build a modular system that can transfer accents or voice styles to users. The final product will be an iOS app or web interface in which the user uploads a video of themselves, selects an accent or voice style (e.g. Homer Simpson), and the output is the same video but speaking with a new voice.

## Objectives

- Determine training dataset
- Determine model to be used
- Successfully transfer specific voice styles from videos (must be high quality output)
- Deploy system via an iOS app or web interface

## Checklist for project completion

- [ ]  I must find the final product satisfactory
- [ ]  Timeline must be reasonable and agreed upon beforehand
- [ ]  System must allow for voice style transfer of **new** and **unseen** voice styles
- [ ]  Interface must be simple and easy-to-use 
- [ ]  Source code must be well commented and fully functional
- [ ]  Voice style transfer must be quick (on the order of seconds)
